## Project Overview:

Welcome to the Equity in post-HCT survival predictions project! This project was developed as part of System Analysis course at Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas. The link of the project is https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/equity-post-HCT-survival-predictions. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that could accurately rank patients by their risk of a survival event (like relapse or death) after a hemopoietic cell transplant (HCT) 
### Objectives:
- Understand the structure of the competition’s system. 

- Learn more about the medical context to apply new ideas accurately as possible. 

- Identify the system’s elements, relationships, and boundaries. 

- Check the sensitivity and complexity of the problem. 

- Analyze the evaluation metric. 

- Propose recommendations to improve the accuracy and fairness of the models.

### Technologies:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend development.
- Python for backend development.

## Workshops Summary

1. **Workshop 1:** Analysis of a kaggle competition.
    - Folder: `first_workshop`
    - Description: This folder contains all materials for Workshop No. 1. It includes a systems analysis report (with elements, relationships, and complexity discussion) that describes the competition overview, visual diagrams, latex source code, and the final PDF report as  required by the assignment.
    - Files: PENDING

2. **Workshop 2:** Kaggle Systems Design
    - Folder: `second_workshop`
    - Description: This folder contains the collaborative work of four team members for Workshop No. 2. It includes a comprehensive system design document analyzing a Kaggle competition, exploring its elements, relationships, sensitivity considerations, and chaos theory implications. The design focuses on a modular pipeline architecture that addresses equity considerations throughout the prediction pipeline.
    - Files: System Design Document (PDF), LaTeX source code, System Architecture Diagrams, References, Step-by-Step Development Guide, README.md

3. **Workshop 3:** PENDING SUMMARY
    - Folder: `third_workshop`
    - Description:
